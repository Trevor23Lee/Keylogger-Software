# Keylogger-Software
This is a basic keylogger, that is able to detect any key strokes, mouse clicking, etc. to then log it into a file. 
The file it will make will be encrypted for security purposes. Then the user with the file and access, can then 
put the file through a pattern analysis using AI/ML.
